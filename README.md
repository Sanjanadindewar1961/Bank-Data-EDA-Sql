# 🏦 MyBankDB - SQL Project

This project represents a **Banking Database Management System** that stores and manages information about customers, their accounts, transactions, loans, credit cards, branches, and ATMs. It is designed to simulate the core operations of a bank using structured data management concepts.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The project demonstrates how a relational database can be applied to the banking sector. It includes the design of database tables, defining relationships between them, and performing operations like data storage, retrieval, analysis, and reporting.

The system handles:

* Customer details and personal information
* Different types of bank accounts with balances and statuses
* Financial transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers
* Loan records with amounts, interest rates, and repayment timelines
* Credit card details including balances and limits
* Branch information for the bank’s physical offices
* ATM details and their service statuses

## 📂 Database Entities

1. **Customers** – Stores information about bank customers such as name, age, and identification.
2. **Accounts** – Contains details of different account types (savings, current, etc.) linked to customers.
3. **Transactions** – Records all financial activities performed by customers through their accounts.
4. **Loans** – Keeps track of loan details, interest rates, repayment dates, and loan statuses.
5. **CreditCards** – Maintains data about credit cards, including credit limits, usage, and outstanding balances.
6. **Branches** – Stores branch-level information about where banking services are offered.
7. **ATMs** – Provides details about ATM machines and their availability status.

## 🔍 Key Concepts Demonstrated

* **Database Creation** – Building a new banking database schema.
* **Data Organization** – Structuring tables for customers, accounts, loans, and other entities.
* **Relationships** – Connecting customers to accounts, accounts to transactions, and customers to loans or credit cards.
* **Data Analysis** – Using aggregates (like totals, averages, and counts) to measure performance and activities.
* **Filtering & Categorization** – Identifying active/inactive accounts, categorizing customers by age groups, etc.
* **Joins & Subqueries** – Combining multiple tables to get meaningful insights about customers and their financial activities.
* **Date Functions** – Tracking current date, due dates for loans, and transaction timelines.
* **Real-Life Scenarios** – Examples include calculating remaining loan days, finding high-value customers, and managing inactive accounts.
